A friend showed me this tip the other day. It's really useful for adding multi-line comments in PowerShell ISE. It can also be used for typing the same thing on multiple lines.
 
1. While holding **alt** and **Shift** press the **up** or **down** arrows to select multiple lines.
1. Add your desired text.
