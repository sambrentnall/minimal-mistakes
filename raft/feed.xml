I keep having to figure out how to do some awesome, but equally challenging things, and have found that help doesn’t seem to exist in a simple and concise way! Everyone works differently and I think that it would be useful if I share some of my ideas with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a SQL DBA by trade, so, expect my posts to mostly be about: SQL, Powershell and Microsoft technologies. However, I do use a Mac as my main machine outside of work so they could swing that way as well. Whatever is peaking my interest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at a blogging platforms I decided to go with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; based website hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, and I used it as an excuse to finally learn GitHub since I use SVN at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been a good excuse to use VSCode for the first time, and so far, I’m loving it!&lt;/p&gt;
